                Hi, I'm Shibly from Peradeniya, Srilanka. I'm a person with an open mind who tries to learn something new every day. I love and believe in self-learning because it bought many achievements in my life.

                I have done my Ordinary and Advance Level at Wesley College Colombo. I was playing rugby for college since under 16. I got 8-As' and 1-B for my O/L. After that, I had an amazing couple of years playing for the college's 1st fifteen rugby team. In the final year, I became the house vice-captain and house rugby captain of my house. I selected mathematics as my advance level stream and finally got 3-Cs'

                 After my A/L I wanted to enter to engineering field but to be honest I had no idea which path to choose. Somehow I wanted to start doing a job after college so I joined Aiges as a customer care executive. Fortunately, at that period uber eats was lounging in Srilanka and Aegis became their partner to handle the customer care operations. I was on that pilot team.

                When I'm working with uber operations I observed how things work behind big named applications and how they interact with different softwares. This experience drove my interest into software engineering. After get promoted as a senior executive and completing a successful year at Aiges I decided to resign from the position and start my studies.

                Currently, I'm following Pearson H.N.D in Software Engineering program at ESOFT. While continuing my academic studies I used to self study more about software development and working on some of my own projects.
           </p><br/>
           <p>
                Now I'm looking forward to improve my skills, create valuable products, and gain a good position in the software industry.
